                    LIFE HAPPENS
                    When life happens what do you do?
                    Evey single person at one point or the other has been faced<br> with one chanllenge or the other, this could be as a result of hardship, disappointment, financial dififulties,<br>misfortune , heartbreak, etc.
 <br>              
                <p></p>
                Hence, having the wrong set of people in our lives can lead to making  unhealthy decisions, rushing into <br>conculsion or rather after taken  the right decision life still happens. Hmmmmm! Hereafter, this can happen to<br> anyone
                How do you cope with the challenges life throws at you? 
                    <p></p>
                    do you just watch and and see it make a mess of you or you turn such mess to to a positive  message to inspire<br> others?
                    It is normal for you to feel disapointed and feel betrayed atfer trying your best only to dicover that<br>  your best was not good enough. LIFE JUST HAPPENS!<br>
 <p></p>              
 To be a succes in life is a mtter of chocice, you have to be intentional about it and take a  huge chuck of<br> responsiblities, you have to be responsible for your actions, interactions and reactions. You can make the choice<br> today to live an inspiring and fulfilling life that will make huge difference for others to emulate.<br> The choice is yours?<br>
             <p></p>
          <center>     <p> <h4><strong>STEPS TO TAKE WHEN LIFE HAPPENS</strong></h4></p> </center>
              
 Review your expectations: Take a closer look at the expectations you had before life happened. Do my<br> expectations set me up for disappointment? Try to learn from this experience it is not easy because you are<br> presently not happy with the situation all these will the change the course of our lives to yielding a better results.<br>  After which you ask yourself how you could potentially adjust them for next time and what is one thing can do<br> differently the next time? Write them down and act on it immediately.
 <br>
                <p></p>
             
  Take responsibility Acknowledge the present situation and move forward better days ahead. Identify your flaws<br> and amend them immediately. Please note that there is no time for pity party. Ann Landers once wrote, “Expect<br> trouble as an inevitable part of life, and when it comes, hold your head high. Look it squarely in the eye,and say,<br> “I will be bigger than you. You cannot defeat me.” For once in your life, the bigger you are, the better! <br>

                <p></p>
                Allow cracks: A crack in your marriage, career, or personal plans doesn’t mean that your life is broken.<br>According to Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, “There is a crack, a crack in everything. That’s how<br>the light gets in.” And one of the most powerful ways to do that is in my experience to let it out into the light and to<br> talk it over with someone close to you.
                <p></p>
<br>                

Hope against hope: There is one thing that never fails HOPE. You need to believe in yourself and stay hopeful.<br> Hope against hope, just believe it going to work out for good. Stay focus and positive.It is not easy but it is worthy<br> it and don’t be afraid to begin again. When you fall the seventh time get up and when you are tired just crawl.</h6>
            </p>  </h6>
            <p></p>
            Take a chill peel: Relax and enjoy yourself. So take some time to rest up, recharge and to have some fun. Just<br> focusing on your goals alone can cause unnecessary stress and anxiety. Sometimes you need to free your head<br> for a while after which you continue the work.
            <br>

            <center>     <p> <h4><strong>THERE IS SO MUCH HOPE</strong></h4></p>  </center>
    


            
            



            I am of the school thought that HARD WORK pays in the long run. You may not get what you want now but later,<br>with the requisite hard work and resilience, you will definitely get what you need.
            <p></p>
            Germany Kent is of the opinion that there is no shortcut for hard work that leads to effectiveness. You must stay<br> focused and disciplined because most of the work is done behind the scenes.”<br> According to Dido Stargaze, “It doesn't' matter how hard your life is, was, or will be, just don't give up”.
So why<br> give up now when you are close to achieving your goals?
Why bury yourself when you are still living?
<p></p>
Why throw- in the towel when you can still use it to dry your skin?
Why being buried in frustration when there is<br> so much hope?
Only if you can think, see and work it out in patience and perseverance. Good success is hard<br> work not for THE WEAK BUT THE WILLED.
<p></p>
Life is simple and can be compared to a GAME. What you need to do is play by the rules, and at the end, record a <br>resounding victory. The rules are usually not appealing, stressful and hard; but all you need is determination<br> and optimism at all cost for a better tomorrow.
Be BOLD and take the right step because THERE IS SO MUCH <br>HOPE for a better tomorrow.
<p></p>
Don’t ever make the mistake of comparing yourself with others. You have a purpose and a destiny which you<br> MUST fulfil. So many people are attached to your destiny which you cannot afford to FAIL.
The tougher the journey,<br> the closer to achieving your goals and fulfilling your purpose, SO DO NOT GIVE UP AND DO NOT FAIL YOUR<br> GENERATION.

Challenges are important parts of life that give you experiences. It make you learn and help you to become<br> wiser and stronger.
Challenges in life can be used to your advantage. Each one is an opportunity for <br>personal growth and self-improvement. Ultimately, the goal is to use what you learn as you grow to become<br> the best version of yourself.
Whether you lose your job, an opportunity, or a relationship, loss is an inevitable<br> part of life. Regardless of how it happens. Can I get  a witness in the comment section?

We all are indeed responsible for wherever we find ourselves.  Our present state is a reflection of our past<br> actions, interactions and reactions to whatever life throws at us. Our decisions reflect our present state. If<br> you want
 to be successful, you have to take 100% responsibility 
for everything that you experience in life<br> which includes your achievements (relationships, health and income, your debts, emotions, career) etc. We all<br> have a mandate to fulfill here on earth, no one here is created without a purpose.  
The earlier we understand<br> this, the better.Hence, 
having this mindset we have to wake up to the call of RESPONSIBILITY.<br> This is not easy!

<br>
<p></p>
GEORGE WASHINGTON CARVER opines that Ninety-nine percent of all failures come from people who have<br> a habit of making excuses.
 Sometimes, some of us tend to shift blame outside of ourselves (We blame our<br> parents, bosses,
  friends, media, spouse and economy) for reasons we did not make through to achieving<br> our set goals. This mind set is totally wrong and must be IGNORED.

<br>
<p></p>
If you want to fulfill purpose here on earth, you have to take 100% responsibility for your actions, interactions<br> and reaction for whatever life throws at you. You must be willing to fight back and stay strong no matter how<br> difficult the situation is. You must be willing to turn your mess to a message of hope and adversity to advantage <br> if you truly want to fulfill purpose. It is not easy but worth it.

Denzel Washington would have never become a<br> movie star, Bill Gates would never have founded Microsoft, and Steve Jobs would never have started Apple<br> Computers. For every reason why it is not possible, there are hundreds of people who have faced the same <br>circumstances and succeeded. So FACE IT.
<br>
<p></p>
Everything you EXPERIENCE today, is as a result of the CHOICES you have made in the past. You have to be<br> deliberate about your actions, Interactions and reactions about anything life throws in your path.
<br>
<p></p>
Actions: <br>

There is a stimulus that prompts you to take a decision before an action is being taken, in that process you<br> have to be conscious of your mindset, filter out all negative thoughts and act positive to every situation.<br> Hence, having a deliberate mindset helps you to become cautious of every action you exhibit and teach you how<br> to sight wrong signals.

Interaction: Interaction is a very virtual part of life. You need to get into the right<br> circle, communicate with people of like minds. Don’t be afraid to ask questions about your actions, most people<br> are afraid to ask for feedback about how they are doing because they are afraid of what the response might be<br> hmmm, I do this a lot but later take courage to get feedback.

There is nothing to be afraid of. The truth is<br> the truth. You are better off knowing the truth than not knowing it, however, once you know, you can retract.<br>  Interaction helps you to improve your life, your relationships, and your performances. Also, pay detailed<br> attention to feedback, this can mar or make you. 
<br>
<p></p>
 

Reactions:
<br>
I believe that everyone has a purpose. Identifying, acknowledging, and honoring this purpose are perhaps the<br> most important action successful people take. They take the time to understand their purpose, stick with it and<br> pursue with enthusiasm.

 Without a purpose in life, it is easy to get distracted and achieve little in the journey<br> of life.
 <p></p>

 NOTE:YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR ACTIONS AND IT IS YOUR DUTY TO TAKE UP RESPONSIBILITY<br> FOR DESTINY OR MESS IT UP IN IGNORANCE. THE CHOICE IS LEFT FOR YOU TO DECIDE.
